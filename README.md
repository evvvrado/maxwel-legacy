> Enhancing your custom games experience in League of Legends.

Maxwel is a specialized League of Legends (LOL) platform designed exclusively for a small, close-knit group of friends who share a passion for the game. Maxwel will use the LOL API to access key player data, including ranks, performance metrics, and recent trends. This data will be used to create fair and engaging custom game experiences for our group, ensuring balanced teams and competitive matches. And Maxwel utilizes the OpenAI API to interpret user input and link it with various developed functions.
